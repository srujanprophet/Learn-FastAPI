"""Use `CORSMiddleware`
- Import `CORSMiddleware`.
- Create a list of allowed origins (as strings).
- Add it as a "middleware" to your **FastAPI** application

You can also specify if your backend allows:
- Credentials (Authorization headers, Cookies, etc).
- Specific HTTP methods (`POST`, `PUT`) or all of them with the wildcard `"*"`.
- Specific HTTP headers or all of them with the wildcard `"*"`.

The default parameters used by the `CORSMiddleware` implementation are
restrictive by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable particular
origins, methods, or headers, in order for browsers to be permitted to use
them in a Cross-Domain context.
The following arguments are supported:
- `allow_origins` - A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. E.g. `['https://example.org', 'https://www.example.org'].
You can use `['*'']` to allow any origin.
- `allow_origin_regex` - A regex string to match against origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. e.g. `https://.*\.example\.org'`.
- `allow_methods` - A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests. Defaults to `['GET']`. You can use `['*']` to allow all standard methods.
- `allow_headers` - A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to `[]`. You can use `['*']` to allow all headers. The `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language` and `Content-Type` headers are always allowed for CORS requests.
- `allow_credentials` - Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to `False`. Also, `allow_orgins` cannot be set to `['*']` for credentials to be allowed, origins must be specified.
- `expose_headers` - Indicate any response headers that should be made accessible to the browser. Defaults to `[]`.
- `max_age` - Sets a maximum time in seconds for browsers to cache CORS responses. Defaults to `600`.
